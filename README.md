# Matchbox
 
Matchbox is a modpack all about Exploration, Enchantment, and Enhancment! The modpack is very much a RPG-like game with added difficulty and progression on top of the normal game. From revisited world generation, to more dangerous mobs, to the various new gear and magic needed to counter them, this modpack has a lot of content to move through, while still sticking relatively close to the vanilla progression loop. 

The pack comes with a number of disabled serverside and clientside optional mods, all of which can be enabled optionally for an improved experience in singleplayer and multiplater. 

Disabled serverside mods, such as Yung's Better Caves and Repurposed Structures will only affect your game while playing in singleplayer, where as the plethora of disabled clientside mods will add quality of life changes or make the game look better. They are usually pretty explanatory, but a quick search will likely inform you of what the mod is all about and if you want to enable it.
